methods: An ARIMA model is fit to the logit-transformed unweighted ILI data
  from ILInet using the forecast R package for each state.  Only data from 
  before any confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state are used in the ARIMA.
  During the time confirmed COVID-19 cases are present in the state, a
  conversion factor is estimated to relate the ARIMA model residual to the
  confirmed COVID-19 cases.  Next, a concave-down quadratic is fit for the
  confirmed COVID-19 cases on a log scale versus time.  Finally,
  the predicted COVID-19 impact on ILI is added to the predicted seasonal-flu
  ILI to create combined estimate.  The prediction distribution is estimated
  from the ARIMA standard errors.
